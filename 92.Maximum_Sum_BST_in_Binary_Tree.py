# Given a binary tree root, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

# Assume a BST is defined as follows:
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
